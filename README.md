The repository has been created for people working with geotechnical centrifuges that usually requires to acquire data at high frequencies.
Due to the amount of data to handle I think it is useful to share the code to cut, filter, and save data.

Everyone is free to partecipate to the improvement of the code but note that the code may be very specific to the needs of the person analysing the data.
